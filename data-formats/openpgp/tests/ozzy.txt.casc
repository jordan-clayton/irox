In Egypt's sandy silence, all alone,
	Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws
	The only shadow that the Desert knows —
"I am great OZYMANDIAS," saith the stone,
	"The King of Kings; this mighty City shows
"The wonders of my hand."— The City's gone,—
	Nought but the Leg remaining to disclose
The site of this forgotten Babylon.

We wonder,—and some Hunter may express
Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness
	Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,
He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess
	What powerful but unrecorded race
	Once dwelt in that annihilated place. 

	- Horace Smith

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

	- Percy Bysshe Shelley
